<h1 id="smashing-mag">Smashing Magazine heat map</h1>

<p>Fifth project of the <a href="https://www.microverse.org/">Microverse</a> curriculum from the CSS3 and HTML section.</p>

<p>In this project, we break apart the website for a popular design magazine with which you’re probably familiar by now –  <a href="http://smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>. The goal for this exercise is to start training to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

The aim is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy.</p>
